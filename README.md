## Project Description

##### Overview:
This project focused on coming up with recommendations for a technology company just entering the online-streaming business. In this project, we explored three key questions, 1) what genre of films make the most money, 2) which actors/ directors are most successful and 3) how much should a company look to spend in advertising in order to maximize the profit from their investment.

##### Challenges:
The data that we analyzed did not specify what movies were released exclusively online. We were able to find a proxy for that information, but the lack of clarity on this point slowed our analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Raw Data can be found on the web. Below are the raw data sources:
