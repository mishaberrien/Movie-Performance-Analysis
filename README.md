## Project Description

##### Overview:
This project focused on coming up with recommendations for a technology company just entering the online-streaming business. In this project, we explored three key questions, 1) what genre of films make the most money, 2) which actors/ directors are most successful and 3) how much should a company look to spend in advertising in order to maximize the profit from their investment.

##### Challenges:
The data that we analyzed did not specify what movies were released exclusively online. We were able to find a proxy for that information, but the lack of clarity on this point slowed our analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Raw Data can be found on the web. Below are the raw data sources:

> * Internet Movie Database, [title.basics.tsv.gz](https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz), (2019), distributed by IMDB.
> * Internet Movie Database, [name.basics.tsv.gz](https://datasets.imdbws.com/name.basics.tsv.gz), (2019), distributed by IMDB.

3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/CliffordBridges/Movie-Performance-Analysis/tree/master/src)
4. You can re-run the entire project from the results notebook [here](https://github.com/CliffordBridges/Movie-Performance-Analysis/tree/master/results)
5. The results of our analysis were presented as a powerpoint, which is now saved as a pdf under **"TFS Project 1_ Microsoft Movie Streaming Analysis.pdf"**
